Dear public diary,

You see the beautiful warning below the image. This blog is about why I added it.

Internet is filled with substandard articles. <a href="post-six-checklist-for-writing-articles">Last time,</a> we discussed about the craft part, but this piece will be about the content. Let's take this website as an example to understand, what can go wrong with the content. 

More than half of the blogs here are  opinions, experiences, or things that the author read somewhere. Being personal is not a problem, but the way is, in which they are presented to the reader. You would often find the author sharing hacks, habits and suggestions that have benefited his life. He must have went through hundereds of articles, videos and books to form these opinions. These resources give ample of associated examples, case studies, edge cases and cautions. These things are crucial in making up mind if someone wants to pick up a habit, or start doing something. The blogs on this website are devoid of these, moreover they don't even the cite the resource where the information has been picked up from. Is there a way to fix this?

All these troubles can be avoided by concentrating more on quality of content than the quantity. Research should be performed before writing each blog. Proper citation to other articles, research or books should be stated in the article. The job of a writer is to present people with the facts, based on which user can form their opinions. If the writer is a critic, they can share their own opinions too, but there is no excuse for not putting forward the all the facts they encountered that gave birth to their opinion.

So, I should not be asking you to do something, without informing you enough about it and its consequences. Imagine a stupid scenario, where I ask you to do a 130lbs squat, and some kid gets his knees fucked. I am not running away from my responsibility of writing properly researched articles, by putting a warning label. It's just not my priority right now, because I am on a mission of learning how to write. Hope you understand. Thanking Abhay for helping me realize this.

See ya tomorrow!!!
