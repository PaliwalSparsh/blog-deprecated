Dear public diary,

I have invested most of my time after moving to Pune in procrastinating. I planned to focus mostly on my next big venture. But, things are not going as planned, why? — Parkinson's law. 

From now on let's call my next venture as **Project NY**.

I have been allocating most of the time of day to Project NY. However, even if I have given 12 hrs to work on it, I only perform 2-3 hrs of deep work. This is the best example of Parkinson's law. I find myself really frustrated knowing that I am not utilizing my time properly. Another realization I had was, that Project NY didn't require 12 hrs on somedays, but it demanded me to work 2-3 hrs religiously every day. This was confirmed by the fact that on the days when I had only 2-3 hrs strictly to work on Project NY, I did it with great focus. 

Ali Abdal is a famous Youtuber and he made me believe that I can work on multiple things at the same time while focusing majorly on Project NY. This way I won't be wasting my time procrastinating with one thing and I won't be frustrated that I am investing my time in only one thing. So in the upcoming month, I will be picking up these things

1. Take vocals/guitar classes or dancing (salsa or other couple dance). Cooking is in the queue.

2. Exercising daily — 3 days heavy workout and swimming. Rest of the 3 days evening bollyfit sessions in the gym.

3. Writing this blog almost daily.

4. Creating videos for these blogs.


I will also use the technique of bunching together similar tasks as taught by ** 4-hour work-week**. 

1. Will record videos, write a lot of drafts in one go. 

2. Editing videos in a bunch, finishing writing drafts in a bunch. 


I know this sounds a lot. But, I know I have time for all of this, I have been procrastinating all this time. This is a fight again my mindset, that I can do only one thing at a time. I know it will work out all great.

See ya, tomorrow!!!

P.S. - Tomorrow is my birthday (29/07/19). *I am turning 24*. **I will become the best version of myself by my next birthday.**
