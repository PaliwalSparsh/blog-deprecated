Dear public diary,

Sorry for not showing up. I will reduce friction by automating the posting process. The aim is to invest a maximum of thirty minutes daily on this blog.

"How to win friends and influence people" and "Extreme ownership" are NYT bestsellers. The first chapter of both books advice the same thing -- stop complaining and criticizing. Incessantly complaining situations and other people thwarts personal growth. On the other hand, criticizing people can hamper relationships.

Criticizing people is futile.  People are blind when it comes to looking at their own wrong. The infamous drug-dealer, Pablo Escobar, thought he was a messiah to people. People get defensive when subjected to criticism. They take it is an attack on their ego. It is the worst way to communicate something message to the other person. A better solution to communicate the concern is by getting into a dialogue. Gradually making the other person realize what is wrong. Meanwhile, ensuring the other person doesn't feel vulnerable or attacked.

Complaining about situations and people is the easiest way to circumvent responsibilities. People often complain to console themselves. They feel they didn't perform and it should be attributed to factors outside of their control. Why they do this? It's the easiest thing to do. Surely, there are situations when things are actually out of control and people should forgive themselves. But, the problem is getting into the habit of blaming. It stops a person from trying out harder and they escape by complaining as soon as they find something difficult. Thus, it is really important to introspect if the complaining is genuine or not.

One should make sure to notice if they have these characteristics in themselves and make gradual attempts to weed them out.

See ya soon!!

P.S. - I want to introduce ambient sounds in my blog.
