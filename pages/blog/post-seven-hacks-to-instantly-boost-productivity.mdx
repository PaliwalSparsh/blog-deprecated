Dear public diary,

People from all walks of life are plagued by similar disorders, and the parasite responsible for it sits in their pockets — mobile phone. Mobile phone usage is often associated to issues like depression and anxiety. But, phone usage also leads to huge productivity loss.

Companies invest millions of dollars into designing addictive apps. Once users are stuck in the habit loop, the apps become necessities, and the users keep coming back to scratch their newly developed itch. To increase this revisiting frequency even further these apps use — notifications. Notifications are disastrous to productivity.

They could be from apps like Snapchat, Instagram, or maybe a friend invitation to play Pubg, but they all are equally harmful. Notifications are highly distracting. It’s really hard for human brain to perform context switching (just like computers). Context switching in terms of computers mean switching between running processes or programs. In case of human brain, it can be understood by the following example -

A person is studying (initial context) and a notification pops up on their phone. They pick up the phone and start using the corresponding app (new context). Once the user does this, it is really hard for their brain to again switch back to the initial task they were working on. Switching contexts is really difficult for human brain.

However, there are  quick and easy hacks that can be employed to fix these problems -

1. **Turn off all the notifications on your phone** - Try to do this for a week to start with. Most people realise after doing this activity that notifications are not important at all to them. 

2. **Declutter home screen, remove all the addictive apps from the home screen** - Picking up the phone and opening each app on the home screen is pretty normal. Suggesting to remove these apps altogether from the phone is not practical, as most people end up installing them again. Removing apps from home screen adds an extra step required to access them. This added frictions will ensure that the frequency at which the app is used goes down.

These simple hacks can improve the productivity of an individual by multitudes.

Well, the formal part is over. My strategy is to just turn off my phone whenever i am working and throw it somewhere, so it is hard to reach. This has been pretty effective for me.

See ya tommorrow!!

P.S. - Going to cafes and working is pretty effective. I will stop considering folks who study/work in cafes as pretentious :P
