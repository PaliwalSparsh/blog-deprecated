Dear public diary,

Today I will share the technique for effectively reading books. It takes me around 2 minutes to revise the content cardinal to any book. Going over this content repeatedly helps me retain the content I have read.

People often ignore the **preface of the book**. But, these 2-3 pages are the introduction of the author and their intention behind writing the book. It gives you a clear picture of what you will get from reading the book, how it has affected the life of others and the author himself. In short, prefaces give you clear purpose and thus motivation you need to read the complete book.

Reading books is not enough. The more **important thing is the application of the things in your life**. To do this **you need to understand the topics you are reading clearly, and have easy availability while you are using them**. The more cognitive effort is required to access this information, less are chances that you would be using it.

Here is my technique to read any non-fiction book effectively — 

**Prerequisites** — A notebook and a pen. ( Don't do this on your computer ).

1. Read preface of the book. Learn about the character of the author and his intentions.

2. Start reading the first chapter. While reading the chapter, **highlight the important concepts that you come across** in the chapter.

3. Take a pause after reading the chapter and do the following — 

    a. Think thoroughly about what you just read. Question yourself on how you can use this information to make your life better or solve existing problems in your life.

    b. If while doing the exercise above forces you to go again and understand something, quickly glance over the things you highlighted.

    c. Once you have thought it through and asked the questions to yourself, the chapter would be mostly clear to you.

    d. Last and most important step is. **Quickly draw diagrams, write a really small summary for the whole chapter**. It should not be more than 4 lines (can have as many diagrams though). Keep in mind, you need to write this section without referring back the book. This should be all you would need from this day, to know what the author said in this chapter. Trim all the obvious and unnecessary information.

4. Repeat step 2 and 3 for all the chapters in the book. You should have notes for the complete book, this should **not be more than 2-3 pages.**

5. The final step is to again go over these 2-3 pages. Take a pencil and strike down all the unnecessary information which you feel is obvious is not of cardinal importance to the idea of the book. Strike down recklessly so that, **you are left with just 5-10 lines of content**.


These 5-10 lines are the summary for the book. This is the easily available version of the book that I was talking about. Although, you might think that those 2-3 pages were brief enough, why prune them again. The truth is, that you would never take the effort to go through either the things that you highlighted in the book or the 2-3 pages notes as they would take significant effort. 

Another thing was clearly understanding the content of the book, this is taken care by writing the summary without referring to the content of the book. This reinforces what you have learned and ensures that you have actually understood the concept.

I hope this helps. I have discovered this strategy after reading, making notes and using the things I learnt from the book in real life situations. And found the method shared above to be most effective.

See ya, tomorrow!!!
