Dear public diary,

Today I will share the technique for effectively reading books. It takes me around 2 minutes to revise the content cardinal to any book. Going over this content repeatedly helps me retain the content I have read.

People often ignore the **preface of the book**. But, these 2-3 pages are the introduction of the author and their intention behind writing the book. It gives you a clear picture of what you will get from reading the book, how it has affected the life of others and the author himself. In short, prefaces give you clear purpose and thus motivation you need to read the complete book. Great, let me just read the book and make my life better.

Reading books is not enough. The more **important thing is the application of the things in your life**. To do this **you need to understand the topics you are reading clearly, and have easy availability while you are using them**. The more cognitive effort is required to access this information, less are chances that you would be using it.

Here is my technique to read any non-fiction book effectively — 

**Prerequisites** — A notebook and a pen. ( Don't do this on your computer ).

1. Read preface of the book. Learn about the character of the author and his intentions.

2. Start reading the first chapter. While reading the chapter, **highlight the important concepts that you come across** in the chapter.

3. Take a pause after reading the chapter and do the following — 

    a. Think thoroughly about what you just read. Question yourself on how you can use this information to make your life better or solve existing problems in your life.

    b. If while doing the exercise above forces you to go again and understand something, quickly glance over the things you highlighted.

    c. Once you have thought it through and asked the questions to yourself, the chapter would be mostly clear to you.

    d. Last and most important step is. **Quickly draw diagrams, write a really small summary for the whole chapter**. It should not be more than 4 lines (can have as many diagrams though). Keep in mind, you need to write this section without referring the book at all. It should be all you would need from this day on to know what the author had to say in this chapter. Trim all the obvious and unnecessary info.

4. Repeat step 2 and 3 for all the chapters in the book. You should have notes for the complete book, this should **not be more than 2-3 pages.**

5. The final step is to again go over these 2-3 pages. Take a pencil and strike down all the unnecessary information which you feel is obvious is not of cardinal importance to the core idea of the book. Strike down recklessly with the intention, that **you should be left with just 5-10 lines of content**.


These 5-10 lines are the summary for the book. This is the thing easily available version of the book that I was talking about. Although, you might think that those 2-3 pages were brief enough, why prune them again. The truth is, that you would never take the effort to go through either the things that you highlighted in the book nor the 2-3 pages notes as they would take significant effort. 

Another thing was clearly understanding the content of the book, this is taken care by writing the summary without referring to the content of the book. This reinforces what you have learned and ensure that you have actually understood the concept.

I hope this helps. I have developed this strategy after reading and making notes for many books. And found that this is the most effective one.

See ya, tomorrow!!!
