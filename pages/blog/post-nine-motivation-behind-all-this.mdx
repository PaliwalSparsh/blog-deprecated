Dear public diary,

This is a note to myself. Why am I even doing this ?

Motivation is temporary. Down the line, when people are stuck, feeling depressed or don’t feel like continuing. They often start questioning themselves — “why did I even start all this?”. But, little do they remember, that they had the answer for this when they started. 

People should write down the things that motivate them on a piece of paper and keep it with themselves. They can refer to the note, to rebound during the phases when they start doubting themselves or their choices. Let’s go through the authors short term motivations behind each articles -

“The story of my life” and “Plan for upcoming month” were used by author to vent out feelings. The bad quality of these two indicate the author was **mostly excited about starting the blog**. “The 20 of productivity” and “How to read effectively” were first two blogs where the author had put consideration into the content. The later one was the first blog to be shared publicly, and faced a lot of criticism (**the motivation was to share the blog with public**). “Process saves times” was all about author’s experience while creating the “quick notes” widget. This was motivated by the frustration of being stuck for straight 6hrs of doing something wrong(**motivation was sharing genuine personal experience**). “Checklist for writing articles” and “Hacks to instantly boost productivity” were exciting as the author was **trying to implement the “writing checklist”** and improve writing. The author had no motivation behind writing “Single storage for information”, and thus the article has no soul at all. So, is the author running short on motivation?
Let’s go through why did the author started the blog. Motivation as shared by the author in his words -

1. “I want to use these blogs as a **blueprint for the youtube videos** that I would be creating”.
2. “From the start I had been pretty bad at english, specifically writing. I want to **write better with less mistakes in my grammar**. Most importantly mastering the art of putting out my thoughts out to people.”
3. “I learn and do a lot of things. I want **to keep a log of these things**. Also, I want a place to share all these things with the world.”
4. “Preparing for the AWAs. LOL.”
5. “Having a space where I can express myself. You can call this as a practise I am doing with myself **to fight my fear of being judged by people**.”
6. “Learning to **handle criticism on my opinions**. Writing things down forces me to think them through and build more solid opinions.”
7. “On the tech side of blog. Implementing new and cool things is great, the repo acts as a avenue for me to learn new things in tech as most of the work I do in my job is lame.”

And, the motivation behind this very blog as shared by author, “It just **feels great sitting in a beautiful cafe and spitting out whatever comes to my head**. It is growing on me.” The author can look back to all the above mentioned things whenever he feels down.

Hope, this helped you understand the motivation behind this whole website. I will someday read all this and laugh at myself. But, I don’t know it just feels great to write what’s in my head and push it publicly.

See ya tomorrow!!

P.S. - I didn’t feel like writing the blog at all today. But, went ahead with it :P
