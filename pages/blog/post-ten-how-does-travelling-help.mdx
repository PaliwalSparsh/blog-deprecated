Dear public diary,

I wanted to complain about traveling. So, here is what I love about it.

The author and his friends started traveling in 2017, they were called to Finland for a Hackathon. For two of them, this was the first trip outside of their country. This experience changed their lives, as it helped them overcome the feeling that traveling is a luxury. They had the misconception that they had to get rich to realize this dream. Since then, the author had traveled to 11 countries( in a span of one and a half year). He says, "Just go... You need to be done with all the incessant excuses. All it takes is one trip to break through all your doubts. It's expensive? How much? You won't know until you give it a try. Believe me, it's not that expensive. Just go ahead, plan the travel and get yourself a visa. Once you start traveling, you will realize how much traveling has got to offer and in what all amazing ways it can impact your life."

Traveling helps people in getting a new perspective on their life. Being away from their normal life, and having enough time to think, they can introspect their lives as a third person. This helps them understand what's going wrong and what can be fixed. "For the first few days of the trip, I forget everything and enjoy as much as I can. But, after a few days, most of my time goes in thinking about life — What's going wrong? What can be improved? How can I get out of these troubles I am in?" says the author. He added, "I feel sorted after each trip. I never feel that I am going back to my sad life. I feel revitalized and super excited to try out new things that I realized and found out during the trip."

This is just one of the aspects of traveling. It offers much more things beyond this like experiencing new cultures, food, and meeting new people.

The point of this blog was to share my most loved aspect of traveling and how it impacts my life.

See ya tomorrow!!

P.S. — Don't drink coffee during evening or night.
