Dear public diary,

Let's write this in a new fashion.

Good things about life - 

1. In Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam with this I have officially been to 11 countries around the world.
2. Reading a lot of good books lately like Extreme ownership, the manual and other amazing books to follow.
3. Consuming great content.
4. New job has got me in contact with a lot of amazing folks.

Bad things going on in life -

1. Not satisfied with the efforts I am putting in for my next venture.
2. Lagging behind my fitness goals.
3. There has been no substantial achievement that I have had in the past ( I personally don't consider getting a higher paying job, moving to another city, buying new things as achivements )
4. Trading my social life for the time in which I can focus on efforts to pursue my goals.
5. Not able to `simplify my major goals` > `prioritize and execute`. And have enough motivation to keep on continuously working with my goals.
6. Not utilising the things I am learning from books in an effective manner.
7. My technical prowess is degrading.

Clearly, there would be a lot more good things going in my life right now. Having a ratio of `4:7` just shows that I am going through a bad day. If I had written this blog yesterday the ratio would have been greater than 1.

See you!!!
