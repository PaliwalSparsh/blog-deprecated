Dear public diary,

Tim Ferris, Jocko Willink, and Cal Newport are my rockstars. Not, because they all are millionaires but because we share a common interest.

Obsession with being productive. I have read many books, watched hundreds of videos, listened to countless talks and podcast on the topic. I have tried a lot of different productivity hacks from tweaking my calendar to buying a notebook for planning, and writing journals. But, the one most celebrated in the productivity community is — **Pareto's Principle** aka **80/20 Principle**

The 80/20 principle suggests that 80% of the outcome is based on 20% of the effort, and rest 20% of the outcome requires you to do 80% of the effort. I applied this principle to a lot of places, but forgot to apply it to the place where it originated.

I realized that I have been trying to learn hundreds of ways of being productive when only 20% will give the highest ROI. So here is my list of the concepts and tricks, that you need to improve your productivity -

1. **Pomodoro** - Use the forest app for Pomodoro.

2. **20/80 principle** - explained already.

3. **Parkinson's law** - More time you give to a task, more it takes. 

    - Plan your next day before hand ( the deep work ).
    - Block your time for different tasks you will be working on.

4. **Discipline is freedom** ( from Extreme Ownership ) 

    - Gyming or other form of exercise everyday.
    - Meditation everyday.

5. **2 minute rule** - If takes 2 minutes to do it. Just do it right now.

See ya, tomorrow!!!
