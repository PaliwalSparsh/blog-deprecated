Dear public diary,

I am gonna write a pretty sophisticated article for you today -

Today, internet is filled with substandard articles. Just like everyother artform, writing has two parts -- art and craft. Art is the idea or content, that an artist has got to share with the world. But, most of them miss out on the craft part, the essential skills required to express these ideas in a way that it is easily understandable to fellow homosapiens.

Countless resources are present to help people master the craft, but there is one which stands out the most. William Zinsser's book "On Writing Well" is a celebrated literature on the topic that has helped a lot of writers to hone their skills. The content of the book can be summarised as follows -

1. There should be clarity about the ideas that author has got to share. They can follow a structure like this - 
    
    a. Problem that is highlighted in the article.
    
    b. Associated facts and research.
    
    c. Solution or suggestion to solve the problem.
    
    d. Conclusion for the article.

2. It is really important that each line in the article feels coherent. Give consideration to the unity of -
    
    a. Pronouns - It is better to settle for Third Person. Using first person instead suggests, that author is sharing their opinions to the reader instead of the facts. It's better to make the reader feel that they are reading facts and can create opinions of their own.
    
    b. Mood - Try to keep the mood as either proffesional or personal. It's completely dependent on the type of article.
    
    c. Tense - Switching continuously between tenses can make it really hard for the reader to make sense of the things.

3. Removing clutter from the article is equally important. Some things to do are - 
    
    a. Take a print out of the article.
    
    b. Strike down all the unnecessary adverbs and adjectives that are present. Ex. Schools are ~pretty~ important. Either schools are important or not. It is expected that the author is confident about what he is writing.

4. The article would be in a good shape by now. The next step should be reading it out loud. This will help the author understand which parts of the text are off, and for the places where rythm can be added by wordplay.

5. The beginning of articles is an important area to focus on. This is where author needs to hook the user into the article. Few suggestions are as follows -
    
    a. Start with some interesting fact which compels the user to read article.
    
    b. Share a story and start it with a BOOM!!

6. Equally critical is to understand where to end an article.
    
    a. Stop when you start summarising or repeating content . **Readers are not dumb**.
    
    b. Try to end with a surprise. Make the reader thirsty for more content.
    
    c. Echo a note that is present in the starting of the article.

These things if kept in mind can result in a pretty lit blog, article. Hope you guys enjoyed.

See ya, tomorrow!!!

P.S. - I want to go back to India. But, I have to stay here for a while.
