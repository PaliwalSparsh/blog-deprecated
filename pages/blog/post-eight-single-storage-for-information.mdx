Dear public diary,

Chaos is one word to describe how most people manage notes, documents and other information. In all its forms, information is spread across different mediums like notebooks, note-making apps, code editors, unorthodox places like walls and obviously brain.

But, why is it even a problem? It's not, if seen from a short term perspective. But, imagine someone trying to find out their notes on english grammar they made 2 years ago. They would need to go through all the mediums, just to find out a small piece of information. Or worse the notebook containing that information was lost or damaged. All these troubles could have been avoided, if the information was properly organised.

Skillshare founder Micheal Karnjanaprakorn suggests, "to keep all the notes at a single place" and using technology to maintain them. This enables easy managing, searching and saves users from redundant efforts. Basic expectation from a tool that tries to solve the discussed problems would be -

1. **Easy management** - Ability to tag and group notes.
2. **Availability** - Notes should be easily available.
3. **Search capability** - Searching through hundereds of notes quickly.

One of the popular solutions that packs all these is Evernote ( digital notekeeping app ). But, it has got it's own set of problems and additional features which are worth mentioning -

1. **Available everywhere** - It has apps for mobile phone, desktop, and tablets ( across all major operating systems )
2. **Great note management** - Users can arrange notes inside a notebook and even these notebooks can be grouped together.
3. **Supports all formats** - It supports images, pdfs, videos and obviously text.
4. **Great search** - This is the most valuable feature to save time. Evernote lets user search through all the documents including text present in images, pdfs or other things present. This is helpful as users can capture images of notebooks and search content through them aswell.
5. **Constant updates** - The app gets constant updates to fix bugs and add new features.
6. **Great editor** - The editor in evernote is super powerful. Hope, a support for markdown is added in the future.

Coming to the bad things - 
1. Really **buggy at times**
2. At rare times **synchronisation issues** can cause users to lose data.
3. Large images and PDFs will cause the application to slow down significantly.
4. It's not priced well for indian market (current price is Rs1500/year)

Other great options like Notion, OneNote by microsoft (free) not discussed here, and are equally impressive. All these tools have free trials available, so users can try out what suits their needs and be convinced before spending their money. This post is created in evernote.

See ya tommorrow!!

P.S. - Can someone tell me if coffee is good for health or not.
