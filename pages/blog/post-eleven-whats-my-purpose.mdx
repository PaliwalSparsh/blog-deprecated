Dear public diary,

People often question themselves, “Why do I exist? What to do next? What’s the purpose?”. It’s pretty common to ask these questions and is often referred as life crisis.

Biologically, the only purpose of humans is to reproduce and save their species from extinction. “When I was in college. I used to think about this often. Until, one day I came to the realisation — my ultimate goal is to reproduce, take care and grow up my offspring, and he/she can do the same ,” says the author. He added, “This constitutes to a really small phase of my life, what should I do with the rest of my life? All my wing mates and me were on a trip. I finally asked one of my amazing friend, why should I even live, when the main purpose is ephemeral?”. The author’s friend replied, “experiences, live for experiences. Experiences are the mini purposes that give you a reason. I have never questioned myself since then ever. Even when I did I realised it’s time to get a new experience”.

Experience can be trying to open a startup, giving a TED talk, writing a book, learning to play guitar, going through college, or maybe getting better at dating. Think about life in form of short experiences and cherish each one of them. Don’t think about what the past had, or what the future has in store. Try to live in the present, and excel in whatever the current experience has got to offer.

See ya tomorrow!!

P.S. - I know the length of blogs is reducing day by day.
