Dear public diary,

You see the "Quick Notes" widget towards the bottom right section of the screen. It took me 6 hrs to make it.

The problem was that although I had coded the widget, I was not satisfied with its aesthetics. To fix the way it looked, I kept on changing CSS properties (let's call it "Tweaking" from now on), to try out different possible ways in which widget can be designed. Obviously, I was saving myself the trouble to go to my designing tool and create the widget. 

After introspection I realized the problem was, not following the process. A proper process would have ensured that I would have been caring just the implementation at the code level. A better approach to introducing a widget in the blog would have been -

1. Quickly laying out requirements for the widget on paper

2. Drawing the widget on paper.

3. Designing the widget on Figma (designing tool).

4. Start implementing i.e. coding

**If you look closely, as I move from step 1 to 4. The effort required to tweak and try different designs increases exponentially.**

You can see, how not following the process, cost meÂ 6 hrs.

See ya, tomorrow!!!

P.S. - I am still struggling to prioritize things, need to fix this.
